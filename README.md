👋  Hi, I’m Dom Nasrabadi

👀  I have experience mainly in SQL and R. However, I've written code in VBA, Python, HTML and React-Native too in the past.

🌱  I’m interested in learning more about NLP and advanced machine learning models

💞️  I'm open to collaborating on interesting research projects that require any sort of data analysis

📫  You can reach me on my Linkedin (on the side) or my email at dom_nasrabadi@hotmail.com

You will notice most of my repos contain pdf documents coming from my RMarkdown Scripts. I think pdf is the most accessible and shareable file format (especially among laymen or those just learning) so if you want to quickly skim what a project or repo is about just check the main pdf which will be outlined in the ReadME. 
Enjoy!
