👋 Hi, I’m Dom Nasrabadi

I am a final year uni student finishing a double bachelors in Business Analytics & Professional Accounting. I've also been working as a Data Analyst at a Big 4 
Australian Bank for the last few years. 

👀 I have experience in SQL, R, VBA and Python

🌱 I’m interested in learning more about NLP and advanced machine learning models

💞️ I'm open to collaborating on interesting research projects that require any sort of data analysis

📫 You can reach me on my Linkedin (on the side) or my email at dom_nasrabadi@hotmail.com

You will notice most of my repos contain pdf documents coming from my RMarkdown Scripts. I think pdf is the most accessible and shareable (especially among laymen or those just learning) so if you want to quickly skim what a project or repo is about just check the main pdf which will be outlined in the ReadME. 
Enjoy!
